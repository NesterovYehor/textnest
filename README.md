# TextNest – The Terminal-Powered Code Sharing Tool

## The Story Behind TextNest  

It all started when I stumbled upon [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop) (by the way, they serve the best coffee in your terminal!). It was such a cool and effortless experience that it sparked an idea:

> *What if there was a tool for developers who are tired of building UIs but still need a fast, secure way to share code snippets?*

That’s how **TextNest** was born – a **developer-first, terminal-friendly tool** designed to make text and code sharing fast, secure, and scalable without the clutter of traditional interfaces.

This repository contains the **backend** side of the project. Here, you'll find all the details about the **technical implementation, architectural decisions, and design choices** that make TextNest what it is. For more details on the broader project, check out the full documentation.

For the **CLI/SSH tool**, check out the companion repository: [txtnest-cli](https://github.com/NesterovYehor/txtnest-cli).

## Why TextNest?

### Designed for Speed, Security & Simplicity

- **Fast & Scalable** – Built with microservices for maximum performance.  
- **Secure** – JWT authentication ensures safe access.  
- **Developer-Friendly** – API-first approach, with an SSH interface coming soon.  
- **Reliable Storage** – Metadata in PostgreSQL, caching with Redis, and files in Amazon S3.  
- **Minimalist, Terminal-First Approach** – No need for UIs. Just focus on getting things done.

## Tech Stack – What’s Under the Hood?

| **Technology**  | **Purpose** |
|---------------|------------|
| **Go** | High-performance language, ideal for microservices. |
| **gRPC** | Efficient, lightweight service-to-service communication. |
| **PostgreSQL** | Secure storage for metadata. |
| **Redis** | In-memory caching for speed. |
| **Amazon S3** | Reliable, scalable file storage. |
| **Kafka** | Event-driven architecture for automated paste expiration. |
| **Docker** | Simplifies deployment and scalability. |
| **Nginx** | Load balancing for high availability. |
| **JWT (Auth Service)** | Ensures secure authentication. |

With this tech stack, **TextNest is built to perform at scale while ensuring security and developer efficiency.**

## System Architecture – How It Works

TextNest is a **microservices-based** application with distinct services:

- **API Service** – Handles all HTTP requests.  
- **Auth Service** – Manages user authentication via JWT.  
- **Upload Service** – Securely stores pastes in S3.  
- **Download Service** – Retrieves stored pastes securely.  
- **Hash Generator** – Generates unique IDs for pastes.  
- **Expiration Service** – Deletes expired pastes using Kafka.  
- **Metadata Storage** – PostgreSQL (structured data) + Redis (caching).  

Everything runs in **Docker**, making deployment a breeze.

## Getting Started – Set Up in Minutes

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NesterovYehor/textnest.git
cd textnest
```

### Configure the Services

Most services use `.yaml` configuration files. Example API config:

```yaml
database:
  user: youruser
  password: yourpassword
s3:
  bucket: textnest-bucket
redis:
  url: redis://localhost:6379
auth:
  service_url: http://auth-service:8081
jwt:
  secret: your_secret_key
```

### Run Everything with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## What’s Next?

- **SSH Interface** – Share and retrieve pastes directly from the terminal.  
- **Admin Dashboard** – For advanced management and monitoring.  
- **Public & Private Snippets** – More control over who sees what.
