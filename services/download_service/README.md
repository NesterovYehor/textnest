# Download Service for TextNest

## Overview

The **Download Service** is an essential component of the TextNest project, facilitating secure and efficient delivery of paste content. It ensures that requested pastes are retrieved and served reliably while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Features

- **Content Retrieval**: Efficiently fetches paste content from storage for users.
- **Access Control**: Enforces permissions to ensure only authorized users can access specific pastes.
- **Secure Delivery**: Supports secure data transfer protocols to protect user data.

## Architecture

### Service Communication

The Download Service integrates seamlessly with other components of the TextNest ecosystem:

- **Storage Access**: Fetches paste content from the storage layer.
- **Metadata Service Integration**: Retrieves metadata for validation and access control.
- **API Layer**: Serves content directly to users or other services through RESTful endpoints.

### Workflow

1. Receive download requests via the API.
2. Validate requests by interacting with the Metadata Service.
3. Retrieve content from the storage system.
4. Deliver the content securely to the requester.

## Logging

The service utilizes [slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog) for comprehensive logging. Logged details include:

- Incoming download requests
- Metadata validation and access checks
- Storage interactions and retrieval status
- Errors and anomalies for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

- Support resumable downloads for large files.
- Add monitoring for download performance metrics.
